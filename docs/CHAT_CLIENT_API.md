# 1.`call()` Return Values

After specifying the `call()` method on `ChatClient`, there are a few different options for the response type:

- **`String content()`**  
  Returns the string content of the response.

- **`ChatResponse chatResponse()`**  
  Returns the `ChatResponse` object that contains multiple generations and metadata about the response, e.g., how many tokens were used to create the response.

- **`ChatClientResponse chatClientResponse()`**  
  Returns a `ChatClientResponse` object that contains the `ChatResponse` object and the `ChatClient` execution context, giving access to additional data used during the execution of advisors (e.g., relevant documents retrieved in a RAG flow).

- **`entity()` to return a Java type**:
    - **`entity(ParameterizedTypeReference<T> type)`**: Returns a collection of entity types.
    - **`entity(Class<T> type)`**: Returns a specific entity type.
    - **`entity(StructuredOutputConverter<T> structuredOutputConverter)`**: Specifies an instance of a `StructuredOutputConverter` to convert a string to an entity type.

You can also invoke the `stream()` method instead of `call()`.

# 2.`stream()` Return Values

After specifying the `stream()` method on `ChatClient`, there are a few options for the response type:

- **`Flux<String> content()`**  
  Returns a `Flux` of the string being generated by the AI model.

- **`Flux<ChatResponse> chatResponse()`**  
  Returns a `Flux` of the `ChatResponse` object, which contains additional metadata about the response.

- **`Flux<ChatClientResponse> chatClientResponse()`**  
  Returns a `Flux` of the `ChatClientResponse` object that contains the `ChatResponse` object and the `ChatClient` execution context, giving access to additional data used during the execution of advisors (e.g., relevant documents retrieved in a RAG flow).
